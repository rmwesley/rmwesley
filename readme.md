Some minimalist evangelism: use `zathura` as a PDF reader!

`zathura document/report.pdf`

Also, you can convert `.md` files to `.pdf` or `.html` format with pandoc:

`pandoc readme.md -o readme.pdf`

Excuse my use of my nationality as a personality trait, but the Brazilian status is too cool not to abuse a bit xd.
