Some minimalist evangelism: use `zathura` as a PDF reader!
<sub><sup>And vim as an IDE lol<sup><sub>

`zathura document/report.pdf`

Also, you can convert `.md` files to `.pdf` or `.html` format with pandoc:

`pandoc readme.md -o readme.pdf`

Excuse my use of my nationality as a personality trait, but allow me to abuse it a bit xd.
